# Geo-Database-of-Betonia
build a geo data base for Betonia city using ArcGIS pro, then create app on ArcGIS online (enterprise)

🗺️ Land Use & Parcels GIS Project
📌 Overview

This project focuses on building a geodatabase for managing land use and parcel information within the city. It is designed to serve as a foundation for spatial data management and to support future web applications that allow citizens and decision-makers to easily access land-related information.

Currently, the project contains three sample blocks from the city as a starting dataset. Over time, it will expand to cover the entire urban area.
